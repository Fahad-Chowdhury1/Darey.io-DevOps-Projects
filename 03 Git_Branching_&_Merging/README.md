# Git Branching and Merging

### Merging Changes 


within this part of my project i will be merging changes made previous to Tom & Jerry's branches and creating pull requests (PR)

---

I firstly open my web browser and go to the GitHub page for the repository. (see img below)

I then proceed to switch from my main branch to the branch Tom worked on, in this instance that would be the 'Update-Navigation' branch.

Next step is to generate a pull request on the page.

### Reviewing Toms changes

Over here the base is set to the main projects branch and checks it against Toms branch to compare them.

Below before creating the pull request i would review the changes to ensure everything is correct.
