<h1 align="center">Remote EC2 server creation on AWS</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## <u>Introduction</u>
Within this mini-project my aim is to set up a virtual remote server using AWS on their EC2 instance and I will gain access to it via my local environment. I will then proceed to connect to that server in the cloud, remotely straight from my computer.

<br>

### <u>AWS Instance Configuration</u>
After creating my AWS account I have navigated to the AWS dashboard where i will begin to configure and launch my instance to get it ready.
