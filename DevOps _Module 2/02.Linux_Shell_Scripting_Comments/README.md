# <p align="center">Linux Shell Scripting Comments</p>


### <u>Introduction</u>

In this project i will introduce myself to the comments aspect of shell scripting within linux. Comments are essential in programming, serving as notes to the programmer and anyone else who might read the code. They examplin what the script or parts of the script do, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### <u>What are Comments?</u>
Comments are lines in my code that are ignored by the interpreter. In Bash scripts, comments help document the purpose and logic of my code, making it easier for others and myself to follow and understand the scripts functionality.

#### <u>Single-Line Comments</u>
Single line comments in Bash start with the '#' symbol. Anything following this symbol on the same line is treated as a comment and not executed.

Example command line:
echo "Hello, I am learning Bash scripting on Darey.IO!" # This is also a comment, following a command

#### <u>Using Multiple Single-Line Comments</u>

I'll execute the below command for multiple single-line comments. This approach is straightfoward and is commonly used for adding brief descriptions or notes spanning multiple lines.

#### <u>Best Practices for Commenting</u>

Clarity - Writing clear and concise comments that explain the "why" behind the code, not just the "what"

Maintainability - Keeps comments updated as i modify the code to ensure they remain relevant and helpful.

Usefulness - Comment on complex or non-obvious parts of the script to provide insights into my thought process and decision making.
